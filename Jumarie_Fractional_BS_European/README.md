# Jumarie_Fractional_BS_European

This Matlab File is aimed at solving Jumarie Fractional BS formula (2010) using Numerical Analysis (Fractional Backward Euler)

I use Vanilla Put Option as an example, and set the boundary value to satisfy European Put Option condition. 

In this file,

FracEu_Put_Be.m is the main function solving European Put Option under Jumarie Fractional BS formula.

Other .m files are used in the main function.

Frac_veri.m is used to calculate the order of accuracy.

alpha_jumarie_euro.m is used to analyze the effect of alpha.
